# GIVEN-DATA-TO-EXCEL
This Python code provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library for entering and saving student data to an Excel file. The code enables users to input a student's roll number and name, and upon clicking the "Save Data" button, the information is appended to an Excel sheet named "StudentData."
